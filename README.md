### Hey, I'm Brad.

I'm a fourth-year computer science student at Northeastern University, graduating in 2026.

Currently, I'm a tech lead at [Sandbox](https://sandboxnu.com), building an open-source alternative to HackerRank and CodeSignal.

### Where I've Been

**Wayfair** — Building AI agents and supplier-facing APIs on the supply chain team.

**Citigroup** — Worked directly with trading teams to reduce their workload. Sometimes woke up at 5 am for international calls. Built distributed notification streaming with Kafka producers, reducing batch processing time for margin agreements

**Northeastern Dong Lab** — Published [research](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c01376) in ACS on predictive modeling for polymers.

### Ideas I'm Exploring

**Distributed Ticketing Service** — I missed Bruno Mars tickets. Now I need to understand *why* at a systems level.

**Elevator Scheduling Algorithm** — Got stuck waiting for the elevator for two minutes. There has to be a better way. Historical usage patterns? Predictive queueing?

**Outfit of the Day Platform** — A place to share fits with friends and see where they bought things.
